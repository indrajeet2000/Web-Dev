syntax - <a href="">-text-</a>

The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

-An unvisited link is underlined and blue
-A visited link is underlined and purple
-An active link is underlined and red


Tips and Notes
Tip: If the <a> tag has no href attribute, it is only a placeholder for a hyperlink.

Tip: A linked page is normally displayed in the current browser window, unless you specify another target.
